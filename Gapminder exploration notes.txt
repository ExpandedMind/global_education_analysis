NOTES About Gapminder dataset

Gapminder World Gapminder has collected a lot of information about how people live
their lives in dierent countries, tracked across the years, and on a number of different
indicators. For this project, you should select at least three indicators to investigate.
● Data is provided as Excel spreadsheet files. You will want to use a spreadsheet program to
export each table as a csv file. Have certain regions of the world been growing in your
selected metrics better than others? Are there trends that can be observed
between the selected metrics?
● You will want to look into ways of reshaping your data so that it is tidy, especially if you want to
do comparisons across indicators. Aer joining your data together, your columns
might look like: {Country, Year, Indicator 1 Value, Indicator 2 Value, … }
● Some of the datasets might have been updated since they were collected on Gapminder. If
you use these updated datasets, make sure you document this in your report.


NOTES about the process of gathering information
data has not null vals for men and women in group (25 - 34), same shape so it
was relatively easy to get them added.
Also, I used countries as index for easy data handling
To make things fear, avg of male - woman was calculated to get a final
"avg years of study" in population

Probably I´ll need to add a multi index [Country, Year]
and GDP_Employee, Life expectancy, Human Development, Income per person
